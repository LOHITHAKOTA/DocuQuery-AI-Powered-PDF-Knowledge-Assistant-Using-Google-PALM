# DocuQuery: AI-Powered PDF Knowledge Assistant

## Overview
**DocuQuery** is an AI-powered web application that enables users to efficiently extract, analyze, and summarize textual content from PDF and Word documents. Leveraging **Google PaLM AI** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, the system automates tasks such as **price list analysis, research paper summarization, and resume matching**. It enhances decision-making by offering insightful summaries and structured information retrieval.

## Features
- **Price List Analyzer**: Extracts item details from multiple price lists and compares prices across suppliers.
- **Research Paper Summarizer**: Generates concise summaries of research papers with different length options.
- **Resume Matcher for Hiring**: Matches resumes with job descriptions to identify the best candidates.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Web-based UI)
- **Backend**: Python
- **AI & NLP**: Google PaLM API, LangChain, FAISS (for vector storage)
- **Data Handling**: PyPDF2, Docx (for text extraction)
- **Environment Management**: dotenv (for API key management)
